# Motivation
My primary motivation for this project was that I just wanted to build something and I love ElDewrito. This project could have been built in a more stable and reliable way by using mature libraries for sockets, websockets, HTTP, JSON, etc., but I wanted to learn so I just built them myself. This project is by far not perfect or even optimal for that reason. 

# Build
Built with g++ 12.2.0 (built by MSYS2 project). Use the makefile to build.
